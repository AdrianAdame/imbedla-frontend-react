# Imbedla Frontend React + Tailwind

Imbedla (Plant Monitoring and Care)

Imbedla is a web application (and app) to monitor houseplants and outdoor gardens, providing detailed information about the plant that the user has, including the current soil humidity, temperature, light intensity, among other important variables.
The application will allow the users to distribute their houseplants and gardens by rooms, allowing a better and easy visualization of the information.
